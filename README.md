# bigtime

A Simple, easy to use, cross-platform Bigtime display for theatres, festivals, clubs, etc.

## Getting Started

Bigtime is a cross-platform display and runs on Android, iOS, MacOS, Windows, and on the web!

It offers a basic mode, which is JUST a bigtime.

Advanced mode offers the ability to add set time countdowns or count ups (or both), intermissions, over/under tracking, definable colour changing numbers and/or blinking based on configurable ranges. You can add stopwatches and alarms which can do a number of things such as: flash the screen, play a sound, vibrate (mobile devices only), etc.

There are several helpful settings for theatre/venue/festival techs as well such as:

- Time offset, incase someones master clock says yours is wrong
- Darkmode by default (white text on black), but you can use lightmode, too
- Resizable clocks allow you to make the most of the space
- Namable "sets" (you can rename what you call "sets" too)
- Per-set colour ranges, and flash options
- Manage intermissions/changeover times and track over/under for top and bottom
